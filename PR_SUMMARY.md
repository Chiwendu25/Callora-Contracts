# PR Summary: Owner-Managed Allowlist Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a robust owner-managed allowlist system for the Callora Vault that provides granular control over deposit permissions. The implementation includes three new public functions with comprehensive access control, duplicate prevention, and event emission.

---

## Implementation

### New Functions

1. **`add_address(env: Env, caller: Address, address: Address)`**
   - Adds a single address to the allowlist
   - Owner-only (enforced via `require_owner`)
   - Prevents duplicates automatically
   - Emits `("allowlist_add", owner, address)` event

2. **`clear_all(env: Env, caller: Address)`**
   - Removes all addresses from the allowlist
   - Owner-only (enforced via `require_owner`)
   - Idempotent operation
   - Emits `("allowlist_clear", owner)` event

3. **`get_allowlist(env: Env) -> Vec<Address>`**
   - Returns current list of allowed depositors
   - Public read access
   - Returns empty vector if none configured

### Storage

- **Type**: Persistent Storage (Instance)
- **Key**: `StorageKey::AllowedDepositors`
- **Value**: `Vec<Address>`
- **Rationale**: Easy to audit, efficient queries, clear semantics

## Testing

### Test Coverage: 17 Tests

1. **Basic Functionality** (5 tests)
   - Single address addition
   - Duplicate prevention
   - Multiple address management
   - Complete removal
   - Idempotent clearing

2. **Access Control** (2 tests)
   - Non-owner rejection for `add_address`
   - Non-owner rejection for `clear_all`

3. **Event Emission** (2 tests)
   - `allowlist_add` event verification
   - `allowlist_clear` event verification

4. **Query Functionality** (2 tests)
   - Empty allowlist behavior
   - Full allowlist retrieval

5. **Owner Privileges** (1 test)
   - Owner can always deposit

6. **Lifecycle Management** (1 test)
   - Add after clear workflow

7. **Backward Compatibility** (3 tests)
   - Legacy `set_allowed_depositor` still works

8. **Integration** (1 test)
   - End-to-end deposit flow

### Test Results

```
✅ All 17 tests pass
✅ No regressions in existing tests
✅ ≥95% line coverage achieved
✅ No clippy warnings
✅ Code formatted with cargo fmt
```

## Security Model

### Access Control

| Function       | Owner | Others |
| -------------- | :---: | :----: |
| `add_address`  |  ✅   |   ❌   |
| `clear_all`    |  ✅   |   ❌   |
| `get_allowlist`|  ✅   |   ✅   |

### Trust Assumptions

1. **Owner**: Full control over allowlist; uses secure key management (hardware wallet/multisig recommended)
2. **Backend Services**: Trusted to deposit on behalf of authenticated users
3. **End Users**: Indirect access via backend services (not directly on-chain)

### Threat Mitigation

| Threat                     | Mitigation                                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Owner key compromise       | Use hardware wallet or multisig               |
| Backend service compromise | Rotate keys regularly, monitor deposits       |
| Unauthorized deposits      | Access control enforced on-chain              |
| Duplicate entries          | Automatic prevention built-in                 |

   - Allowlist management section with code examples
   - Trust assumptions and security considerations
   - Example workflows (add service, rotate, emergency revocation)
   - Audit and compliance guidelines

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **No Breaking Changes**

- Existing `set_allowed_depositor` function maintained
- All existing tests continue to pass
- New integrations should use `add_address` and `clear_all` for clarity

---

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Backend Service

```rust
// Owner adds a backend service
vault.add_address(&owner, &backend_service);

// Backend service can now deposit
vault.deposit(&backend_service, &amount);
```

### Rotating Services

```rust
// Clear all and add new service
vault.clear_all(&owner);
vault.add_address(&owner, &new_backend_service);
```

### Emergency Revocation

```rust
// Revoke all access immediately
vault.clear_all(&owner);

// Only owner can deposit
vault.deposit(&owner, &amount);
```

## Performance

### Time Complexity

- `add_address`: O(n) - linear scan for duplicates
- `clear_all`: O(1) - constant time
- `get_allowlist`: O(1) - single read

Where n = number of addresses (typically 1-10 backend services)

### Gas Costs (Estimated)

- `add_address`: ~5,000 gas + ~1,000 per existing address
- `clear_all`: ~2,000 gas
- `get_allowlist`: ~1,000 gas (read-only)

---

## Compliance

### Auditability

- All operations emit events for off-chain indexing
- `get_allowlist` provides transparent view of current state
- Events: `allowlist_add`, `allowlist_clear`

### Monitoring Recommendations

1. Alert on `allowlist_add` events
2. Alert on `allowlist_clear` events
3. Monitor deposit patterns from allowlisted addresses
4. Alert on ownership transfer events

## Security Notes

1. **Owner Key Security**: Use hardware wallet or multisig in production
2. **Backend Service Trust**: Implement proper authentication and audit trails
3. **Event Monitoring**: Set up alerts for allowlist changes
4. **Owner Privilege**: Owner can always deposit (prevents lockout)
