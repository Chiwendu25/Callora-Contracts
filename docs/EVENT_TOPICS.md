# Deterministic Event Topic Catalog

This document is the **canonical, machine-readable catalog** of every event
topic emitted by the Callora smart contracts (`vault`, `settlement`,
`revenue_pool`, `distribute`). It is designed for indexer integrators who need to filter,
subscribe to, or decode Soroban events by topic.

> **Determinism guarantee.** Every topic string listed below is produced by a
> centralized `events::event_*()` constructor in the contract's `events.rs`
> module. The string is passed to `Symbol::new(env, "<topic>")` exactly once
> per constructor, and snapshot-tested to byte-identity. No inline
> `Symbol::new(...)` literals appear at publish call sites (enforced by
> `scripts/check-event-shape.sh`).

## How Soroban Events Work

Each `env.events().publish((topics), data)` call produces a ledger entry with:

- **Topics**: an ordered array of `ScVal` values (typically `Symbol` or
  `Address`). Indexers subscribe and filter by topic position.
- **Data**: a single `ScVal` carrying the event payload (struct, tuple, or
  scalar).

**Topic positions matter.** An indexer filtering on topic[0] = `"deposit"`
must match the exact byte representation of the Symbol. The constructors below
guarantee that representation is stable across contract versions.

## Cross-Contract Topic Overlap

Some topic strings (e.g. `"init"`, `"upgraded"`, `"admin_cancelled"`,
`"distribute"`) are shared across multiple contracts. To disambiguate:

1. **Filter by contract address first.** Soroban event subscriptions are
   already scoped per-contract by the emitting contract's address.
2. **Use topic[1] (subject) for caller identification.** Most events include
   the caller/admin address as topic[1].
3. **Use the data payload for full context.** Structured data fields (amounts,
   balances, flags) distinguish semantically different events that share a
   topic name.

## Topic Shape Reference

The target 3-topic shape (see `EVENTS_INDEX.md`) is:

| Position | Name       | Type     | Description                                     |
|----------|------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Topic 0  | `action`   | `Symbol` | Event name (e.g. `"deposit"`, `"deduct"`)       |
| Topic 1  | `subject`  | `Address`| Primary address (caller, owner, admin, etc.)    |
| Topic 2  | (varies)   | `Address`/`Symbol`| Additional context (recipient, request_id) |

Most existing events use 2 topics `(action, subject)`. Some events (e.g.
`deduct`, `withdraw_to`, `metadata_set`) include a third topic. See
[`EVENT_SCHEMA.md`](../EVENT_SCHEMA.md) for per-event payload details.

## Adding a New Event

1. Add `pub fn event_<name>(env: &Env) -> Symbol` to the contract's
   `events.rs` with a rustdoc comment.
2. Add a snapshot test in `events.rs`'s `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` asserting
   byte-identity to the literal string.
3. Publish via `events::event_<name>(&env)` — never an inline
   `Symbol::new(...)`.
4. Add a row to the relevant table in this document.
5. Run `./scripts/check-event-shape.sh` before opening the PR.
