# Callora Vault — Capability Bitmap

The vault exposes a `capabilities()` view function that returns a `u64` bitmask.
Each set bit indicates a feature that the current contract version supports.
Clients can use bit operations to detect available capabilities without complex
version-string parsing.

The active capability mask for this contract version is `0x0000_0000_0002_8F3F` (`0x28F3F`).

## Querying capabilities

```typescript
// Using @stellar/stellar-sdk
const caps = await client.capabilities();

if (caps & CAP_BATCH_DEDUCT) {
  // safe to call batch_deduct
}
```

```rust
// Inside another Soroban contract
let caps: u64 = VaultClient::new(&env, &vault).capabilities();
let has_batch_deduct = caps & CAP_BATCH_DEDUCT != 0;
```

## Stability guarantee

- A bit position is assigned once and never reused for a different feature.
- Removed features keep their bit **cleared** in future versions; the position stays reserved.
- New features always occupy the lowest available bit index.
- Reserved bits (6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 18–63) are always `0` in the current version.

## Integration checklist

1. Call `capabilities()` once at startup or after detecting a contract upgrade.
2. Cache the result — it is immutable for a given WASM deployment.
3. Use `caps & CAP_<FEATURE> != 0` to gate feature-specific code paths.
4. Treat an unknown bit as a forward-compatible signal: ignore it, do not error.
