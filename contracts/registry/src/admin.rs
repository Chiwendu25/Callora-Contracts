//! Admin cooldown enforcement for the Callora registry.
//!
//! Implements a per-developer cool-off window between registrations to prevent
//! rapid abuse by the same developer while allowing different developers to
//! register concurrently. Every admin-gated entrypoint in
//! [`crate::CalloraRegistry`] must call [`require_cooldown`] before
//! mutating state and [`update_cooldown`] after a successful mutation.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! The last-registration timestamp for each developer is stored in persistent
//! storage under [`crate::StorageKey::DeveloperCooldown`]`(developer)`.
//! There is exactly one authoritative key per developer; the former global
//! `Symbol`-based key has been removed.
