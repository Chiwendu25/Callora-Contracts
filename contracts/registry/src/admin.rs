//! Admin cooldown enforcement for the Callora registry.
//!
//! Implements a cool-off window between critical admin actions to prevent
//! rapid abuse. Every admin-gated entrypoint in
//! [`crate::CalloraRegistry`] must call [`require_cooldown`] before
//! mutating state and [`update_cooldown`] after a successful mutation.
