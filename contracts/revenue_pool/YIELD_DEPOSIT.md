# Revenue Pool Yield Deposits

`deposit_yield(treasury, amount, source)` lets the current revenue-pool admin
deposit accumulated protocol earnings into the pool through one audited
entrypoint.

## Behavior

- `treasury` must be the current admin and must authorize the call.
- `amount` must be positive and is transferred from `treasury` to the revenue
  pool contract using the configured USDC token contract.
- `source` is a short Soroban `Symbol` label for indexers, such as `fees` or
  `yield`.
- `get_cumulative_yield_deposited()` returns the total amount deposited through
  this entrypoint.

## Event

Each successful deposit emits:

```text
topics: ["yield_deposited", treasury]
data:   (amount, source, cumulative_yield_deposited)
```

The token transfer runs before the cumulative metric update and event emission.
All three effects are part of the same Soroban transaction: if the USDC callee
reverts or panics, the metric and event are not committed.

Cross-contract call safety for this path is covered by
`contracts/yield/tests/xcontract.rs`.
