# Errors Contract Storage Documentation

This document outlines the storage keys used by the Errors smart contract, detailing their Soroban storage tiers and the rationale behind their selection.

## Storage Keys Hierarchy

### `DataKey::Admin`
* **Tier:** **Instance**
* **Rationale:** The administrator's address dictates the access control for the entire contract. Because it is globally applicable to the contract and must survive as long as the contract is active, the `Instance` tier is used. This ensures the admin data shares the same Time-To-Live (TTL) as the contract instance itself, preventing access lockouts.

### `DataKey::ErrorReg(u32)`
* **Tier:** **Persistent**
* **Rationale:** This key stores the mapping of specific error codes to their detailed string descriptions. Since this acts as a core registry that protocols and frontends rely on to decode errors, it must be durably stored. `Persistent` storage guarantees that the state cannot be arbitrarily dropped without an explicit archival process, ensuring high availability.
* **TTL policy:** Each registry entry is written with a **~60 day** TTL and refreshed whenever its remaining TTL drops below **~30 days**. The refresh happens on the write path (`register_error`, `update_error`, and `log_error` for a known code) **and on the read path** (`get_error_description`), so a code that integrators actively resolve cannot silently archive. The policy mirrors the workspace convention of `LEDGERS_PER_DAY = 17_280` (`contracts/fee`: `INSTANCE_BUMP_THRESHOLD` = 30 days, `INSTANCE_BUMP_AMOUNT` = 60 days).

* **Bounded values:** Descriptions are capped at `MAX_DESC_LEN` (256 bytes) on both write paths (`register_error`, `update_error`); longer input is rejected with `DescriptionTooLong` before any storage access.

* **Immutability:** `register_error` rejects an existing code with `AlreadyRegistered` and never overwrites. The only mutation path is the explicit `update_error` entrypoint (which rejects unknown codes with `NotRegistered`). This keeps descriptions stable enough to be treated as part of the public interface documented in `docs/ERROR_CODES.md`.

* **TTL extension:** Every successful write (`register_error`, `update_error`) applies the registry TTL policy above via `extend_ttl(REGISTRY_TTL_THRESHOLD, REGISTRY_TTL_BUMP)`, so actively maintained registry entries do not lapse into archival.

* **Events:** Successful writes emit `error_registered` (register) or `error_updated` (update) with topic `(event, admin)` and payload `(code, desc)`; rejected writes emit nothing. See `contracts/errors/src/events.rs`.

### `DataKey::RecentErr(Address)`
* **Tier:** **Temporary**
* **Rationale:** This key tracks the most recent error logged by a specific user address for short-term debugging or rate-limiting. Since this data becomes irrelevant quickly, it uses `Temporary` storage. This significantly reduces state bloat and protocol fees, as the network can naturally drop the data once the TTL expires. It is written with a **100 ledger** threshold/bump and is read through `get_recent_error(user)`.

## Read Paths

| View | Tier read | TTL side effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get_error_description(code)` | `Persistent` (`ErrorReg`) | Refreshes the entry when below threshold |
| `get_recent_error(user)` | `Temporary` (`RecentErr`) | None |

`get_error_description` is a read-through view with a bounded side effect: it only calls `extend_ttl` on the lookup key when the entry already exists, so it never creates a new entry and never charges rent for an unknown code.

## Write Paths

`log_error(user, code)` additionally publishes an `error_logged` event with topics `(Symbol("error_logged"), user)` and data `code`. Only codes that `register_error` previously defined are accepted; an unknown code returns `Error::UnknownErrorCode` and writes nothing.
