//! Event topic Symbol constructors for the Callora Upgrade contract.
//!
//! This module centralizes all event topic strings into dedicated functions,
//! ensuring byte-identity is preserved and preventing accidental topic name
//! drift across call sites.
//!
//! ## Event Overview
//!
//! | Topic               | Trigger                                            |
//! |---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
//! | `"upgrade_started"` | Cooldown check passed; upgrade is authorized       |
//! | `"upgrade_recorded"`| Last-upgrade timestamp persisted in storage        |
//! | `"cooldown_set"`    | Cooldown window updated via `set_cooldown`         |
//!
//! ## Topic Shape
//!
//! All events follow the canonical 2-topic shape used across Callora contracts:
//!
//! ```text
//! topics: (action: Symbol, caller: Address)
//! data:   <event-specific payload>
//! ```
//!
//! Off-chain indexers should filter on `topic[0]` (action) and scope queries
//! to the emitting contract address to avoid cross-contract topic collisions.
