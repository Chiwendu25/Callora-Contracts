//! Read-only capability views for Callora cold storage.
//!
//! Each bit in the `u64` returned by [`capabilities`] represents a distinct,
//! stable cold-storage feature. Bits are assigned once and never reassigned,
//! so clients can detect capability deltas across upgrades with simple
//! bitwise comparison:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let before = old_client.capabilities();
//! let after = new_client.capabilities();
//! let added = after & !before;
//! let removed = before & !after;
//! ```
//!
//! # Mapping to vault cold storage
//! These bits describe features implemented by
//! `contracts/vault/src/cold_storage.rs` (hot/cold split, auto-rebalance,
//! N-of-M cold sweep). Reserved bits (7–63) are always zero.
