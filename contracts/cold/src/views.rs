//! Read-only capability views for Callora cold storage.
//!
//! Each bit in the `u64` returned by [`capabilities`] represents a distinct,
//! stable cold-storage feature. Bits are assigned once and never reassigned,
//! so clients can detect capability deltas across upgrades with simple
//! bitwise comparison:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let before = old_client.capabilities();
//! let after = new_client.capabilities();
//! let added = after & !before;
//! let removed = before & !after;
//! ```
//!
//! # Cold-storage status
//!
//! The vault does not currently expose the cold-storage entrypoints described
//! by these historical bit identifiers. They remain exported so clients can
//! continue to compile against the stable capability registry, but no cold
//! capability is advertised until the vault implementation ships.
