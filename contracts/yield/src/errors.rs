//! Typed error codes for the Callora Yield per-account limits surface.
//!
//! The numeric discriminants in this enum are part of the contract interface
//! and must remain stable over time. Off-chain indexers and SDK integrators
//! branch on these `u32` codes instead of parsing panic strings.

//! | Code | Variant               | Meaning                                                       |
//! |------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | 1    | NotInitialized        | Contract has not been initialized yet                         |

//! | 3    | Unauthorized          | Caller is not authorized for the requested operation          |
//! | 4    | InvalidLimit          | One or more per-account caps are negative or otherwise invalid|
//! | 5    | BetsAtCap             | Account's open bet count is already at the configured cap     |
//! | 6    | PositionsAtCap        | Account's open position count is already at the configured cap|
//! | 7    | SubscriptionsAtCap    | Account's active subscription count is at the configured cap |
//! | 8    | CounterUnderflow      | `clear_*` was called when the corresponding counter was zero  |
//! | 9    | Overflow              | `checked_add` overflow detected on a counter increment        |
//! | 10   | UpgradeRejected       | Storage-migration validator rejected the pending upgrade      |
//!
//! All variants implement [`Copy`] + [`PartialEq`] so they can be returned by
//! value or pinned in arrays without allocation.
