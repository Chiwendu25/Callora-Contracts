//! Capability bitmap for the Callora Vault contract.
//!
//! Each bit in the `u64` returned by [`capabilities`] represents a distinct,
//! stable feature supported by this contract version.  Bits are assigned once
//! and never reassigned to a different feature, so clients can rely on them
//! across upgrades.
//!
//! # Quick-start
//! ```ignore
//! let caps = client.capabilities();
//! if caps & CAP_BATCH_DEDUCT != 0 {
//!     // safe to call batch_deduct
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See `docs/CAPABILITIES.md` for the full bit registry and integration guide.
