//! # Read-only views for the Callora Vault contract.
//!
//! This module hosts the [`CalloraVault::simulate_deduct`] pre-flight view,
//! which mirrors [`crate::CalloraVault::deduct`]'s validation pipeline
//! end-to-end without performing any state mutation. Clients use it to
//! predict the outcome of a real `deduct` call before signing and submitting
//! a transaction.
//!
//! ## Guarantees
//! - **Read-only.** `simulate_deduct` does not write to instance, persistent,
//!   or temporary storage; does not transfer tokens; does not call into the
//!   settlement contract; and does not emit events.
//! - **Auth-free.** It does not call `require_auth`. The `caller` parameter
//!   is accepted for parity with `deduct` but is not authenticated.
//! - **Parity.** For any given vault state and inputs, the return value is
//!   exactly what a real `deduct` call with the same arguments would return
//!   for the validation-stage checks (pause, amount, max-deduct,
//!   idempotency, rate-limit, balance, slippage).
//!
//! The simulation stops at the validation stage and does not reach the
//! external call or settlement-credit step — so a vault with no
//! `settlement` configured would simulate as if it were configured.
//! Production callers should still call
//! [`crate::CalloraVault::get_settlement`] before submitting a real `deduct`.

/// Read-only pre-flight of [`crate::CalloraVault::deduct`].
///
/// Performs every validation step that `deduct` performs, in the same order,
/// except authorization, external token transfers, the settlement callback,
/// idempotency-marker writes, rate-limit state writes, balance mutations, and
/// event emission.
///
/// # Parameters
/// Identical to [`crate::CalloraVault::deduct`] so that callers can swap
/// `simulate_deduct` for `deduct` and keep the rest of their code unchanged.
///
/// - `_caller`: accepted for parity. **Not authenticated.** The simulation
///   does not raise `Unauthorized` for an unknown caller — it reflects what
///   the subsequent authorized `deduct` would do.
/// - `amount`: amount to deduct. Must be positive.
/// - `request_id`: optional idempotency key. If `Some(id)` and the id is
///   already in storage, the simulation returns `DuplicateRequestId`.
/// - `max_fee_bps`: slippage guard. Same semantics as `deduct`.
/// - `developer`: developer whose rate-limit bucket is checked.
///
/// # Returns
/// - `Ok(new_balance)` — the projected vault balance after the deduct would
///   succeed. This matches `deduct`'s success payload (`Result<i128, ..>`)
///   one-for-one.
/// - `Err(VaultError)` — the same error variant a subsequent `deduct` with
///   identical arguments would emit at the matching validation step.
///
/// "Returns same struct as deduct" (issue #511) is interpreted as
/// `Result<i128, VaultError>` shape parity — the projected new balance on
/// success, the matching error variant on failure.
///
/// # Errors
/// Mirrors `deduct`'s validation errors in the same order:
///
/// 1. [`VaultError::Paused`] — vault is paused.
/// 2. [`VaultError::AmountNotPositive`] — `amount <= 0`.
/// 3. [`VaultError::ExceedsMaxDeduct`] — `amount > max_deduct`.
/// 4. [`VaultError::DuplicateRequestId`] — `request_id` already processed.
/// 5. [`VaultError::RateLimited`] — developer's bucket would be exhausted.
/// 6. [`VaultError::InsufficientBalance`] — vault balance < `amount`.
/// 7. [`VaultError::Slippage`] — `amount` exceeds `max_fee_bps` of the
///    current balance (skipped when `max_fee_bps == u16::MAX` or balance
///    is 0).
///
/// [`VaultError::Unauthorized`] is **not** raised here. Production callers
/// should separately verify that they (or their backend) hold the
/// owner / authorized-caller role before submitting the real `deduct`.
///
/// [`VaultError::SettlementNotSet`] is **not** raised here — the simulation
/// does not reach the external settlement call. Callers that need this
/// assurance should additionally call
/// [`crate::CalloraVault::get_settlement`] before submitting.
