//! Kani proof harnesses for `CalloraVault::deduct` balance conservation.
//!
//! The vault's successful `deduct` path moves `amount` out of the tracked vault
//! balance and credits that same `amount` to settlement. These harnesses model
//! that state transition with the same arithmetic preconditions enforced by the
//! contract and prove that the combined accounting total is unchanged.
//!
//! # Current deduct signature
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! pub fn deduct(env: Env, caller: Address, amount: i128, request_id: u64) { … }
//! pub fn batch_deduct(env: Env, caller: Address, items: Vec<(i128, u64)>) { … }
//! ```
//!
//! `request_id: u64` is an idempotency token that is forwarded intact to
//! `settlement_client.record_deduction`.  It is **not** part of the balance
//! arithmetic.  The model therefore accepts `request_id` as a parameter but
//! does not use it in any computation, and the proof
//! [`kani_deduct_conserves_total_supply`] verifies that the `request_id` range
//! has no effect on the conservation property.
//!
//! Run with:
//! ```bash
//! cargo kani --package callora-vault --harness kani_deduct_conserves_total_supply
//! cargo kani --package callora-vault --harness kani_deduct_request_id_conserves_total_supply
//! cargo kani --package callora-vault --harness kani_batch_deduct_conserves_total_supply
