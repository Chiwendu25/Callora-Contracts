//! Kani proof harnesses for `CalloraVault::deduct` balance conservation.
//!
//! The vault's successful `deduct` path moves `amount` out of the tracked vault
//! balance and credits that same `amount` to settlement. These harnesses model
//! that state transition with the same arithmetic preconditions enforced by the
//! contract and prove that the combined accounting total is unchanged.
//!
//! Run with:
//! ```bash
//! cargo kani --package callora-vault --harness kani_deduct_conserves_total_supply
//! ```
