//! Event topic Symbol constructors for the Callora Topics contract.
//!
//! All event topic strings are defined here to keep the XDR byte layout
//! stable and prevent accidental renames from silently breaking off-chain
//! indexers.
//!
//! ## Topic shape
//!
//! All events follow the canonical single-topic shape:
//!
//! ```text
//! topics: (action: Symbol, ...)
//! data:   <event-specific payload>
//! ```
