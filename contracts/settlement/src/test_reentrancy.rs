//! Reentrancy tests for [`CalloraSettlement::withdraw_developer_balance`].
//!
//! The attack scenario: a custom token contract intercepts the USDC `transfer`
//! call and immediately calls back into `withdraw_developer_balance` for the
//! same developer and the same amount.  With the CEI fix in place the balance
//! is written to persistent storage **before** the transfer is executed, so the
//! re-entrant call observes a zero (or insufficient) balance and is rejected
//! with `InsufficientDeveloperBalance`.  Without the fix, both calls would
//! observe the original balance and the developer could withdraw twice.
