//! Preservation Property Tests for SPDX Header Bugfix
//!
//! **Validates: Requirements 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5**
//!
//! This test suite verifies that the SPDX header fix preserves all existing behavior:
//! - Compilation succeeds
//! - All tests pass
//! - events.rs header remains unchanged (if it exists)
//! - Code functionality is identical
//!
//! **IMPORTANT**: These tests follow observation-first methodology.
//! They capture the baseline behavior on UNFIXED code and verify it remains unchanged after the fix.
//!
//! **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: Tests PASS on both unfixed and fixed code (confirms no regressions)
