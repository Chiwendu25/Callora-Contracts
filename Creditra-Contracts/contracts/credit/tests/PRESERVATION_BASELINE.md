# Preservation Baseline Observations (UNFIXED Code)

**Date**: Task 2 execution
**Purpose**: Document baseline behavior on UNFIXED code before applying SPDX header fix

## File First Line Observations

### events.rs
**First line**: `//! Event types and topic constants for the Credit contract.`
**Status**: NO SPDX header present (contrary to bugfix.md assumption)

### lib.rs
**First line**: `#![no_std]`
**Status**: NO SPDX header present (confirmed bug condition)

### types.rs
**First line**: `//! Core data types for the Credit contract.`
**Status**: NO SPDX header present (confirmed bug condition)

## Compilation Status (UNFIXED Code)

**Command**: `cargo build -p creditra-credit`
**Result**: FAILED
**Reason**: Pre-existing syntax errors in lib.rs (multiple incomplete `draw_credit` declarations)

**Error Details**:
```
error: this file contains an unclosed delimiter
  --> contracts\credit\src\lib.rs:2136:3
   |
109 | impl Credit {
    |             - unclosed delimiter
...
216 |     pub fn draw_credit(env: Env, borrower: Address, amount: i128) -> () {
    |                                                                           - unclosed delimiter
...
230 |     pub fn draw_credit(env: Env, borrower: Address, amount: i128) {
    |                                                                     - unclosed delimiter
...
```

**Note**: These syntax errors are SEPARATE from the SPDX header task and should NOT be fixed as part of this bugfix.

## Test Execution Status (UNFIXED Code)

**Command**: `cargo test -p creditra-credit`
**Result**: CANNOT RUN (compilation fails due to pre-existing syntax errors)

**Expected after syntax errors are fixed**: All tests should pass on unfixed code (baseline)

## File Integrity Observations

All three files:
- ✓ Are readable as UTF-8 text
- ✓ Have multiple lines of content
- ✓ Contain valid Rust code/comments (aside from lib.rs syntax errors)
- ✓ Have reasonable file sizes (>100 bytes)

## Preservation Requirements

After applying the SPDX header fix, the following MUST remain unchanged:

1. **events.rs content**: All lines should remain the same OR gain SPDX header consistently
2. **lib.rs content**: All lines except the first should remain unchanged
3. **types.rs content**: All lines except the first should remain unchanged
4. **Compilation**: Should succeed once pre-existing syntax errors are fixed (outside this task)
5. **Tests**: Should pass with identical results once compilation works
6. **File integrity**: All files remain readable, valid UTF-8, with valid comment syntax

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### events.rs
**Expected first line**: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` (if in scope) OR unchanged
**Expected second line**: Blank line (if header added)
**Expected third line**: `//! Event types and topic constants for the Credit contract.`

### lib.rs
**Expected first line**: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`
**Expected second line**: Blank line
**Expected third line**: `#![no_std]`

### types.rs
**Expected first line**: `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`
**Expected second line**: Blank line
**Expected third line**: `//! Core data types for the Credit contract.`

## Testing Strategy

Since compilation is blocked by pre-existing syntax errors, the preservation tests are designed to:

1. **Document baseline observations** (this file)
2. **Provide file-level tests** that verify file integrity and content preservation
3. **Provide compilation/test execution tests** marked as `#[ignore]` until syntax errors are fixed
4. **Run successfully once syntax errors are resolved** to verify preservation

## Next Steps

1. ✓ Document baseline observations (this file)
2. ✓ Write preservation property tests
3. ⏳ Wait for pre-existing syntax errors to be fixed (outside this task's scope)
4. ⏳ Run preservation tests on unfixed code to establish baseline
5. ⏳ Apply SPDX header fix (Task 3)
6. ⏳ Re-run preservation tests to verify no regressions
