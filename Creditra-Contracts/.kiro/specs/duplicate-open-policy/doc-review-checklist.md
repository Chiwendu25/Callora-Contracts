# Documentation Review Checklist - Task 11.5

## Requirements Coverage Verification

### Requirement 6.1: Active Status Behavior Documentation

- ✅ Error message documented: "borrower already has an active credit line"
- ✅ Behavior clearly stated: "Rejects with error"
- ✅ Result documented: "Panics: 'borrower already has an active credit line'"

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ Use case explained: "Borrowers who have resolved defaults can receive new credit lines"
- ✅ Status transition documented: "Defaulted → Active" with trigger "Backend calls open_credit_line with new parameters (reopening)"
- ✅ Field reset behavior documented in "Reopening Behavior" section

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

### Requirement 6.5: Summary Table/Section
**Requirement**: THE Credit_Contract documentation SHALL include a table or section summarizing the duplicate open policy for all status values

- ✅ Columns: Existing Status, Behavior, Result
- ✅ All status values covered with clear outcomes
- ✅ Additional "Field Reset Behavior" table with rationale
- ✅ "Backend Integration Considerations" section with guidance

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Error Message Verification

### Implementation vs Documentation Comparison

| Error Condition | Implementation (lib.rs) | Documentation (credit.md) | Match? |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| credit_limit <= 0 | "credit_limit must be greater than zero" | Documented in "Error Handling" section | ✅ YES |
| interest_rate_bps > 10000 | "interest_rate_bps cannot exceed 10000 (100%)" | Documented in "Error Handling" section | ✅ YES |
| risk_score > 100 | "risk_score must be between 0 and 100" | Documented in "Error Handling" section | ✅ YES |
| Duplicate Active | "borrower already has an active credit line" | Documented in "Duplicate Open Policy" section | ✅ YES |

**Status**: ✅ ALL ERROR MESSAGES MATCH

---

## Field Reset Behavior Verification

### Implementation vs Documentation Comparison

| Field | Implementation (lib.rs:177-184) | Documentation (credit.md) | Match? |
|-------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| utilized_amount | Set to 0 (line 179) | "Reset to 0" with rationale "New credit line starts with no utilization" | ✅ YES |
| last_rate_update_ts | Set to 0 (line 183) | "Reset to 0" with rationale "Rate change history does not carry over" | ✅ YES |
| status | Set to Active (line 182) | "Set to Active" with rationale "All reopened lines become Active" | ✅ YES |
| credit_limit | Set to provided value (line 177) | "replaced with new values" | ✅ YES |
| interest_rate_bps | Set to provided value (line 180) | "replaced with new values" | ✅ YES |
| risk_score | Set to provided value (line 181) | "replaced with new values" | ✅ YES |

**Status**: ✅ ALL FIELD BEHAVIORS ACCURATELY DOCUMENTED

## Status Behavior Verification

### All Status Transitions Documented

| Status | Can Reopen? | Documented? | Location |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| None (new borrower) | Yes | ✅ YES | Duplicate Open Policy table |
| Active | No | ✅ YES | Duplicate Open Policy table + Active Credit Lines section |
| Closed | Yes | ✅ YES | Duplicate Open Policy table + Non-Active section + Status transitions table |
| Suspended | Yes | ✅ YES | Duplicate Open Policy table + Non-Active section + Status transitions table |
| Defaulted | Yes | ✅ YES | Duplicate Open Policy table + Non-Active section + Status transitions table |
