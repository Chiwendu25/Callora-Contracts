# Implementation Plan: Duplicate Open Policy

## Overview

This implementation plan focuses on comprehensive testing and documentation for the duplicate open policy in the `open_credit_line` function. The existing implementation already supports the desired behavior (rejecting duplicate Active credit lines while allowing reopening of Closed, Suspended, and Defaulted credit lines). This plan adds thorough test coverage and explicit documentation to make the implicit behavior explicit and verifiable.

## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP
- The existing open_credit_line implementation already supports the duplicate open policy - no code changes needed
- Focus is on comprehensive testing and documentation to make implicit behavior explicit
- Property tests provide additional confidence but unit tests alone can achieve 95% coverage
- Each test references specific requirements for traceability
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation
