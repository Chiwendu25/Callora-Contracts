# Bugfix Requirements Document

## Introduction

The repository has inconsistent SPDX license identifiers across Rust contract source files in the `contracts/credit/src/` directory. This violates organization policy requiring all contract sources to have consistent SPDX-License-Identifier headers. The bug affects two files (lib.rs and types.rs) which are missing the MIT license header that is correctly present in events.rs.

## Bug Analysis

### Current Behavior (Defect)

1.1 WHEN contracts/credit/src/lib.rs is examined THEN the system has no SPDX-License-Identifier header at the top of the file

1.2 WHEN contracts/credit/src/types.rs is examined THEN the system has no SPDX-License-Identifier header at the top of the file

1.3 WHEN comparing license headers across contract source files THEN the system shows inconsistent header presence (events.rs has it, lib.rs and types.rs do not)

### Expected Behavior (Correct)

2.1 WHEN contracts/credit/src/lib.rs is examined THEN the system SHALL have `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` as the first line of the file

2.2 WHEN contracts/credit/src/types.rs is examined THEN the system SHALL have `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` as the first line of the file

2.3 WHEN comparing license headers across all contract source files THEN the system SHALL show consistent SPDX-License-Identifier headers in the same format

### Unchanged Behavior (Regression Prevention)

3.1 WHEN contracts/credit/src/events.rs is examined THEN the system SHALL CONTINUE TO have `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` as the first line

3.2 WHEN the contract code is compiled THEN the system SHALL CONTINUE TO compile successfully without errors

3.3 WHEN the full test suite is executed with `cargo test -p creditra-credit` THEN the system SHALL CONTINUE TO pass all tests

3.4 WHEN code coverage is measured THEN the system SHALL CONTINUE TO maintain at least 95% line coverage

3.5 WHEN the contract functions are invoked THEN the system SHALL CONTINUE TO execute with identical behavior (no functional changes)
